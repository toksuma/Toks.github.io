== Getting Started with LEDE

LEDE is based on link:https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start[OpenWrt] &mdash; most of the operational aspects of the two projects are identical.
This document frequently refers to pages of the OpenWrt wiki.

Although there are many ways to install LEDE on your device and complete its initial configuration, the following steps are reliable:

. *Flash the LEDE firmware image into your device.* The exact process is device-specific.
Follow the OpenWrt links below to find the required information for your device:
.. *Find your device's architecture and processor types.*
The "Device Page" of the link:https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start[OpenWrt Table of Hardware] will contain this information.
If you have an unbranded / low-end / low-cost router that came shipped with OpenWrt / LEDE, you can find out the architecture it is using by connecting to it over ssh and opening `/proc/cpuinfo`. A combination of the `system type` and `machine` is what you are looking for.
.. *Download the proper LEDE firmware image to your computer* from link:https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/[downloads.lede-project.org.]
The directory structure for LEDE is identical to OpenWrt's downloads.
.. *Follow the flashing instructions* on the OpenWrt Device Page.
.. On routers: *Connect via Ethernet using DHCP.* After flashing, make sure your computer is connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) port of the router using DHCP.
.. On other devices: *Connect the device to your router.* The device will acquire an address using DHCP. Check your router's web-interface to learn which address it got.
. *SSH to the device.* +
In your terminal program, enter `ssh root@192.168.1.1` (on other devices, replace 192.168.1.1 with the address assigned to the device by your router). You can follow along with the steps below in the link:transcript.html[SSH Transcript].
. *Set the password.* +
LEDE ships without a password. Enter `passwd` and type the new password twice.
_Note: Use a good password: it secures your home network.
Write it on the bottom of the device so you don't forget._
. *Connect the Wide Area Network (WAN) port (if any) of the device to "the internet".* +
A router's WAN port defaults to DHCP, so you can usually connect the  WAN port of your new router into a LAN port of your existing router. The new router should then be "on the air."
. *Confirm internet connectivity* +
Type `ping 8.8.8.8` (that is Google's DNS server.) If the previous step worked, you should see ping response messages.
. *Update the packages, then install the LuCI web configuration package.* +
We recommend the SSL-based package, but you could use the non-SSL version (named 'luci', not 'luci-ssl').
.. Enter `opkg update`
.. Enter `opkg install luci-ssl` to get the SSL-based web GUI.
. *At this point, the Web GUI is available.* +
Go to https://192.168.1.1 to complete configuration.

== Next Steps

* Review the link:transcript.html[SSH Transcript] to see all the messages from the configuration commands above.
* Enable Wi-Fi in the router (LEDE ships with Wi-Fi turned off). See *Network -> Wireless* in the Web GUI.
* Install other packages with `opkg install ...` Useful packages are snmpd, netperf, luci-app-sqm, and any of your favorites.
