This is the default configuration:

----
config dropbear
	option PasswordAuth 'on'
	option RootPasswordAuth 'on'
	option Port         '22'
----

=== Multiple dropbear instances

Edit /etc/config/dropbear to add a second instance.
----
vi /etc/config/dropbear
----

The below example shows one on port 22 on the lan side, one on port 2022 on the wan side.  Note: wan side is set for PasswordAuth off so make sure you have added an ssh-key.

Also make sure to check your firewall DNAT (port forward) to allow access to the wan side port, 2022 in this case.

----
config dropbear
	option PasswordAuth 'on'
	option Port '22'
	option Interface 'lan'

config dropbear
	option PasswordAuth 'off'
	option Interface 'wan'
	option Port '2022'
