RPC daemon
==========

== RPC daemon

In 'LEDE' we commonly use 'ubus' for all kinds of communication. It can provide info from various software as well as request various actions. Nevertheless, not every part of 'LEDE' has a daemon that can register itself using 'ubus'. For an example 'uci' and 'opkg' are command-line tools without any background process running all the time.

It would be not efficient to write a daemon for every software like this and run them independently. This is why 'rpcd' was developed. It's a tiny daemon with support for plugins using trivial 'API'. It loads library `.so` files and calls init function of each of them.

=== Default plugins

There are few small plugins distributed with the 'rpcd' sources. Two of them ('session' and 'uci') are built-in, others are optional and have to be build as separated `.so` libraries. Apart from that there are other projects providing their own plugins.
