This is the repository of the old LEDE web presence.

The files in here mostly serve historical interest, the actual web
presence is maintained in the wiki nowadays.

--

This is the repository of the LEDE web pages.

All pages should follow these rules

* written using asciidoc
* changes are verified using aspell
* changes to the rules.txt files are not allowed without a prior vote

Top level pages are located in this directory while the "Documentation"
can be found in the docs/ sub-folder.

The _includes/ folder contains the html structure of the site navbars, 
if you add a page please add it in the respective nav bar so that it 
becomes reachable.

The website is generated from asciidoc using jekyll invoked by a cron script
every 15 minutes.

If sources are updated to require new jekyll plugins or a changed configuration
then tell someone with access to the web server so that the settings can be
synchronized with those in the tree.

In order to generate the pages locally for testing your changes,
install https://jekyllrb.com/, issue "jekyll serve" and navigate to
http://127.0.0.1:4000/ with your browser.

LICENSE is TBD and should be placed in the LICENSE file once decided.
