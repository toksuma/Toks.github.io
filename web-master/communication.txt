Project Communication
=====================

== Communication

It is possible to communicate with other community members using mail and IRC.
All project related communication should be done on public channels that are
archived and easily browsable. Specific problems and tasks may be resolved
using direct means of communication.


=== Mailing Lists

The project offers the following mailing lists

. https://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev[lede-dev@lists.infradead.org] -
  This list is used for submitting patches and general development related work.
. https://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-adm[lede-adm@lists.infradead.org] - 
  This list is used for project organisational purposes. Anyone can
  subscribe and read this list, only committers may write to this list.

In addition there are two read only announcement lists:

. http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-bugs[lede-bugs@lists.infradead.org] -
  This list receives bug tracking notifications from Flyspray.
. http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-commits[lede-commits@lists.infradead.org] -
  This list tracks the commits to our `source.git` and `web.git` repositories.


=== IRC Channels

The project provides 2 IRC channels on freenode

. #lede-dev - a public channel for everyone to join and participate.
. #lede-adm - a moderated channel that anyone can join but only people with +v flag can write on.


=== Twitter

In case of services going down, being moved or being unreachable for any other
reason, please go to twitter and see what the status is. The project will do
its best to post updates link:https://twitter.com/lede_project[here].


=== Corporate Contact

Please direct general inquiries to
link:mailto:lede-contact@lede-project.org[lede-contact@lede-project.org] in order
to confidentially get in touch with the link:about.html#people[project developers].

Note that this contact is primarily intented to find a suitable mode of
cooperation and to inquire about project matters without having to disclose
your corporate identity upfront. There will be no special treatment beyond the
"first contact". Please see the project link:rules.html[rules] for further
information.

Actual development should happen in public and corporations are strongly
encouraged to send their contributions through the public mailing lists or in
the form of Github pull requests.

== Project Meetings

We attempt to have regular IRC meetings to discuss and decide project matters.
