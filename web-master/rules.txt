Project Rules
=============

== Current Rules

. The only role distinction within the _LEDE_ project is between committers
  and non-committers, there is no core developer group or other specially
  privileged members.
. All committers have the right to vote and are invited to liberally exercise
  this voting right in order to keep a broad consensus on project matters.
. Project matters, overall development directions etc. are decided by simple
  majority votes. Votes may be held in different ways like simple yes/no
  decisions, majority decisions among multiple proposed choices etc.
. Committers being unreachable for three months in a row shall get their
  commit and voting rights revoked in order to retain the ability to do
  majority votes among the remaining active committers.
. There shall be only full commit rights in any case, no partial access or
  otherwise restricted access to the repositories.
. Frequent contributors may become committers after a simple majority
  agreement among existing committers. Project members are free to suggest
  suitable people.
. Any votes and decisions made will be made public on the project websites.
. Project infrastructure should be outsourced FOSS community operated
  services whenever possible in order to allow project members to focus on
  actual development efforts.
. Any infrastructure that cannot be outsourced and/or is operated by the
  project itself shall be administrable by at least three different people
  to reduce the likelyhood of the project getting locked out due to operators
  being unreachable. Responsible operators for the various services shall be
  documented publicly.
. The project will not offer email accounts under its project domain for
  privacy and equality reasons.
. Changes to these rules require a two third majority among the committers
  holding voting rights and shall be documented.
. Be nice to eachother.
