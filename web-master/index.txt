LEDE - Linux Embedded Development Environment
=============================================

== Welcome to the LEDE project

The LEDE project is a Linux based embedded meta distribution based on OpenWrt
and targeting a wide range of wireless SOHO routers and non-network devices.

LEDE spun away from the mother project in May 2016, aims for an open governance
model and attempts to simplify contributing to encourage new developers in
embedded development.

Refer to our link:about.html[about page] to learn more about the projects
origins.

=== How can I use LEDE?

Since LEDE is a pretty young spinoff from OpenWrt it is largely compatible to
it, in most cases the same installation procedures can be used to flash your
devices.

Sysupgrades from OpenWrt to LEDE or vice versa are supported but it is advised
to not keep settings in such a case to benefit from the updated defaults.

=== What is LEDEâ€™s target audience?

As a source based Linux distribution for wireless routers, LEDE is primarily
intended for networking enthusiasts, wireless communities, embedded Linux
developers and advanced users.

LEDE aims for versatility and ease of customization but does not attempt to
be a fully integrated alternative to OEM firmware, it rather is a set of
building blocks to implement your own projects.

=== How can I help?

Like any open source project, LEDE lives from the effort being put into it by
its users and developers. If you like to participate in development, please
refer to our link:development.html[development sub page] to learn more about
source code access and building instructions.

If you do not consider yourself a developer but want to participate in
maintaining documentation or in helping community members then don't hesitate
to join our https://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev[mailing list]
or IRC channels to get in touch.
