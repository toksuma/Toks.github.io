== Snapshot builds

The current master branch is regularly processed by a buildbot setup and the
resulting images can be found on https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/

You can find the BuildBots activity in the following links:

* Phase 1: http://phase1.builds.lede-project.org/builders[target/subtargets]
* Phase 2: http://phase2.builds.lede-project.org/builders[packages]

Please refer to link:signing.html[the file signing documentation] to learn how
to verify the integrity of the firmware downloads.

=== Mirrors

The contents of the download server are available on several mirrors as well.
Please refer to the list below for alternative locations.

=== How to mirror

Please use `rsync://downloads.lede-project.org/downloads` to obtain a copy of
the download repository.

Syncing the downloads share every 12 to 24 hours hours is ideal. Once a mirror
has been set up, feel free to announce it at `lede-adm@lists.lede-project.org`
so that it can be published on this page.

The data volume of the snapshots is roughly 35GB, we expect it to grow by
30-40GB with each release. Due to current bandwidth constraints we kindly ask
you to use something like `rsync --bwlimit 8000` when initially pulling the
data.

=== Sources

Any source code archives fetched by the buildbots during the build process are
available at http://sources.lede-project.org/
